h1. RFile 

"Travis":http://travis-ci.org build status: !https://secure.travis-ci.org/cmaujean/rfile.png!

A read only file class, providing random line based access to a large file without loading the whole file into memory.

h2. Synopsis

<code>
  require 'rfile'
  f = RFile.new('path/to/some/file')
  
  f.line(6) #=> "the 6th line in the file"
  
  f.each do |l|
    # ordered iteration of each line in the file (IO intensive)
  end
  
  # lines returned by randomline mehtods are "consumed" and will not be seen in future calls
  # if recycle == true, then once all lines have been seen, the index is reset
  # and all lines will again be available
  f.randomline #=> "a random line from the file"
  f.randomlines(3) #=> ["a random line", "another random line", "again, a random line"]
  r.length #=> the number of lines available to randomline methods before the end, or before recycling
  r.r_eof #=> true if all lines have been seen
</code>

h2. new(path, recycle, sep_string)

@f = RFile.new('path/to/file', true, "\n")@

h3. path

h1. RFile 

"Travis":http://travis-ci.org build status: !https://secure.travis-ci.org/cmaujean/rfile.png!

A read only file class, providing random line based access to a large file without loading the whole file into memory.

h2. Synopsis

<script src="https://gist.github.com/1315533.js?file=synopsis.rb"></script>

h2. Usage

h3. new(path, recycle, sep_string)

@rfile = RFile.new('path/to/file', true, "\n")@

*path*: the path to an existing file

*recycle*: boolean value, if true the randomline method will reload the index (fast) when it runs out of unique lines to produce

*sep_string*: the string that determines what a line is, lines returned by the methods do not include the separator

h3. randomline

a random line from the file (or nil if no lines are left and recycle == false)

h3. randomlines(num)

an array of random lines with _num_ elements

h3. line(line_number)

the specific line at <span style="font-style: italic;">line_number</span>

h3. Also, the Enumerable module is mixed in, so you get a bunch of that stuff as well.
